Purpose driven procurement practices have the potential of shaping a huge section of the economy. With our current climate crises, we need more incentives to reduce the CO2 our societies are producing. I've outlined the bigger picture within this article [Innovation, Procurement and Sustainability](https://medium.com/openconcept-stories/innovation-procurement-and-sustainability-c9e8f887715b) but have this as a place for rough notes and examples.

# B Corp & Diversity/Sustainability Contracting
Providing example language for contracts and RFPs to:
- help encourage Certified B Corporations (B Corp) adoption
- more diverse business ownership (women, indigenous, worker owed businesses)
- support carbon neutral and other sustainable businesses

## Principals

- If we want to encourage adoption of B Corps, we have to influence the procurement process
- If companies are going to go through the effort to make the conversion to B Corps, they need to see that there is demand
- Organizations need to show that price isn't the only factor in their decision making

## Sample Language for B Corp

In the selection process for this RFP, we will give preference to companies who are Certified B Corporations (B Corp). 

B Corp and other purpose driven entities will be given preference in the selection process.
